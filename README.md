**Course:** Web Design (Fall 2023)  
**Created by:** Kayla Rada

## ✨ Overview  
This was my first full HTML and CSS website, built during my very first semester in college. It’s a personal site that includes pages for my bio, family, hobbies, and career history. At the time, we hadn’t learned JavaScript yet, so everything was built using only basic HTML and CSS. I remember being so proud seeing it come together, even with its simplicity, it felt like my personality was finally online in code. Looking back now, I can see how far I’ve come, but this site still means a lot to me.

## 🚗 CCARR Breakdown (Challenge, Context, Action, Result, Reflection)

### 🔹 **Challenge / Context**  
This project was my introduction to building websites from scratch using HTML and CSS. The assignment was to create a personal site that showcased who we are; no templates, just code. I had never written HTML before, and it felt a little overwhelming at first, but also super exciting.

### 🔧 **Action**  
I created a basic multi-page website with internal navigation, individual pages for my family, hobbies, and career path, and some creative styling using CSS gradients, absolute positioning, and animations. I also added fun details like a side menu, image cutouts, and page-specific styles (each section has its own `.css` file). This was all hand-coded using a simple text editor.

### ✅ **Result**  
The site worked exactly as I hoped—it felt like a digital scrapbook of my life. While there were no advanced interactions yet, it was the first time I saw how code could turn into something personal and expressive. It gave me a solid foundation in how to organize HTML, link stylesheets, and structure a multi-page site.

### 💭 **Reflection**  
This site was the first big step in my coding journey. While it’s basic by today’s standards, I love how it reflects where I started. It taught me how to build with confidence, experiment with layout, and troubleshoot my own code. Since then, I’ve built far more complex projects using JavaScript, frameworks, responsive design, and more—but I’ll never forget how proud I was to get this first site working. I'd love to revisit this project someday, maybe rebuild it with animations, interactivity, or a responsive layout.
