    <h2>Welcome</h2>
  <p>My Name is Kayla Rada. I used to go by Kayla Anderson, but when I met the love of my life, I took his name. Its the least I could do for everything he does for me everyday.
    Im a wild child at heart, an artist, and a nerd, but most importantly, Im understanding. Ive been throught a lot in a short time, but Ive learned to stay positive and embrace the challenges that come my way. 
    Ive always had a passion for art and creativity, and have pursued various forms of it throughout my life. Whether its through paining, drawing, photography, or video games, I find solace in
    expressing myself through visual art. My journey hasnt always been easy, and Ive faced my fair share of challenges along the way. But through it all, Ive learned to be resilient, and never give up on myself or my dreams.
    Now, Im embarking on a new chapters of my life: going to school, navigating a full-time career, understanding retirement accounts (haha!) Im excited to share my passions and experiences with others
    through this portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and getting to know me better.
