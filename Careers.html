            <td>RB Drive In</td>
            <td>When my mother decided to move on from her job after seven years, I stepped up to take her place.
                It was a significant milestone for me, as it marked the first time I had to handle cash transactions and accurately count and give back change. 
                Working there also taught me the value of being resourceful and thinking outside the box to solve problems. Overall, it was a valuable experience 
                that helped me grow both personally and professionally.</td>
            <td>Learned the hard way that not all bosses are great leaders.</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Certified Nurse Assistant</td>
            <td>Aspen Gardens</td>
            <td>I took on a job at this place mainly because of the flexible schedule it offered; I could work from 2 PM to 10 PM, 
               leaving me plenty of time to enjoy my social life afterward. However, what I didn't anticipate was the valuable life lessons I would learn while working there. 
               I learned a great deal about health and caring for others, which allowed me to form authentic relationships with the clients. As part of my job, 
               I helped manage their medication, prepared meals, and assisted with their personal hygiene needs. All of these experiences helped me grow as an individual 
               and taught me the importance of empathy, kindness, and compassion.</td>

            <td>Columbia Gorge Discovery Center</td>
            <td>Located in a small town in Oregon, this place holds a special place in my heart. During my time there, I developed a deep appreciation for nature and solitude, 
              learning to clear my head and enjoy my own company. I even had the opportunity to decorate and cater my first wedding, which sparked a passion for event planning. 
              Perhaps someday I'll pursue a career as a wedding coordinator, all thanks to the unforgettable experiences I had in this place</td>

            <td>City Brew</td>
            <td>I once thought that my calling was to make coffee for tips, hoping to take a different career path. However, I quickly realized that I wasn't cut out for making coffee,
                as I would worry too much about whether the drink I served was up to par. Despite this, my time there wasn't a complete waste, as I discovered a new genre of music that
               I still listen to every day. And as a bonus, I also found out that a Chai Tea Frappe is hands down my favorite drink to order now.</td>
            <td>"Sink or swim" isn't a good retention strategy.</td>

            <td>Pinchaser - Assistant Manager</td>
            <td>Sleeping Giant Parks</td>
            <td>Of all the jobs I've had, this one was the most fulfilling and also the longest one. I always looked forward to coming to work and seeing what new challenges 
               and experiences the day had in store for me. It was a family-like atmosphere, and my boss was the best; even today, I would go to great lengths to help them if they needed me. 
               I started from the bottom, working as a back mechanic, then moved on to the front desk, cooking, bartending, and ultimately became an assistant manager at a new park. 
               I would have happily stayed there for much longer, but I met my future husband while working there, and I wanted to spend more time with him, which meant taking on a new job with a more regular 8-5 schedule.</td>
            <td>Leaving a company can feel like a breakup.</td>

          <td>Loader Operator</td>
          <td>Sparrow Enterprises</td>
          <td>When I started working for this small family-owned business, I was eager to learn how to operate heavy machinery. Fortunately, my husband was the manager there, 
            and he took the time to teach me how to operate a Cat 966 front-end loader in just one weekend. It was a job that demanded a lot of me, often requiring me to start as early
             as 3 AM on snowy days or work in scorching 106-degree heat until 6 PM. Nevertheless, this job taught me the value of hard work and discipline, lessons that have stayed with me throughout my life. 
             I learned that I couldn't be afraid to get dirty or covered in grease, even in places where it should never be.</td>
         <td>I never let a man stand in my way. I wanted to prove that I could do anything I set my mind to, even in a male-dominated industry.</td>

         <td>Dispatcher</td>
          <td>Copart</td>
          <td>Getting my first 8 AM-5 PM job was a dream come true, and this place had everything I was looking for. The leaders and coworkers were exceptional,
             and I gained a wealth of technological skills that sparked my interest in pursuing a computer science degree. I was surprised at how quickly I could learn
              and became intimately familiar with every aspect of the business in less than a year. Although I could have had a bright future there, the only way to move up was to leave the state,
               and I realized I had reached the top of the totem pole. I knew that if I wasn't learning and growing, I couldn't continue with them."</td>
         <td>I gained confidence and learned to say 'no' to customers when necessary and to stand up for what is right.</td>
         <tr>
         <td>Office Manager</td>
         <td>Caliber Collision</td>
         <td>My previous experiences have led me to where I am today, working and learning in a new company and industry. I see a bright future here, 
            and I am excited about the numerous opportunities that lie ahead. This company truly cares about its employees and is revolutionizing the auto body industry,
             which makes it an exciting place to work. Best of all, I can continue my education while being part of a team that is making a real difference.</td>
         <td>I learned that the only thing standing in the way of my advancement is myself. All I need to do is apply myself.</td>
