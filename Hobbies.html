         <h3>Twitch Streaming</h3>
         <p>I've always been a big fan of video games. It all started when I was in diapers - we had a Nintendo 64, a GameCube, and even a Wii.
            As I got older, my interest in gaming only grew. I started playing on PlayStations and Xboxes, and eventually, I built my own full computer.
            At first, I just played games for fun, but eventually, I started streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kayslayyz" target="_blank">Twitch.com</a>. It was a great experience, but it definitely came with a 
            steep learning curve. If and when I get back into streaming go ahead and click the link and say Hi!

        <h4>Gym & Lifting</h4>
        <p>I find myself thoroughly enjoying my daily trips to the gym, where I'm able to challenge myself physically and mentally while also finding a sense of inner peace. 
          It's amazing how quickly my mood can improve after a good workout, and this positivity carries over into my day-to-day life. 
          In fact, I've even started to embrace mornings thanks to the positive impact of exercise. I would highly recommend making exercise a regular part of your routine,
          as the benefits are truly remarkable.
